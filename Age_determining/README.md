# Determining the age of buyers
The online supermarket is implementing a computer vision system to process customers' photos.
Capturing photos at the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:

- Analyze purchases and recommend products that may interest customers in that age group.
- Monitor cashiers' compliance when selling alcohol.

Build a model that can approximate a person's age based on a photograph. You have a dataset of people's photos with their corresponding ages.
