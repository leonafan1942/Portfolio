# Oil Well Location Selection
The goal of the project is to predict the profitability and risk of extracting oil in three regions, each containing 10,000 oil fields. The budget for well development in each region is 10 billion rubles. The task is to select 200 wells. At current prices, one barrel of oil generates a revenue of 450 rubles.

The outcome of the project is a model to determine the region where extraction will yield the highest profit. The profitability and risks are analyzed using the Bootstrap technique.
