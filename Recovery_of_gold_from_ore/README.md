# Recovery of gold from ore
The goal of the project is to create a model that predicts the recovery rate of gold from gold-bearing ore. The data available includes parameters related to the mining and processing stages. The model aims to optimize production by identifying and avoiding unprofitable operating conditions.

The processing process consists of three stages: flotation, primary cleaning, and secondary cleaning.

The dataset contains various parameters for each cleaning stage.

__Problem Type:__ Data analysis, regression, custom metrics
